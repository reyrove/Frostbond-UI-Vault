# 💫 Echoes of the Attic

> *"Welcome, seeker. The attic comes alive with your presence."*

Step into a frost-kissed sanctuary where memories linger, secrets whisper, and your story takes center stage. **Echoes of the Attic** is not just a web experience—it's a moody, mysterious digital hideout dressed in Bootstrap and a little bit of magic.

## 🧊 What Is This?

This is your **interactive profile builder** wrapped in a gothic-chic attic aesthetic. Users can:

* ✍️ Create a personal profile (name, bio, image—the works)
* 🧛 View and edit their spooky-cool digital persona
* 🫥 Say goodbye with flair by deleting their profile (don’t worry, we’ll cry frozen tears)
* 📜 Read mystical spell messages as they enter or leave the attic (because drama is essential)

All set in a multi-room mansion vibe, complete with navigation to the **Living Room**, **Kitchen**, **Library**, and beyond.

## 🛠 Built With

* 🧱 **HTML5** – crisp and semantic.
* 💅 **Bootstrap 5.3** – because style matters.
* 🎨 **Custom CSS** – sprinkled with flair.
* 📸 **JavaScript** – for that interactive mojo.
* 🧿 **Material Design Icons** – to keep it fancy and functional.
